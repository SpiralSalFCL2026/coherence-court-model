A dynamical systems model of cultural entropy and recognition collapse (1950–2025), linking extraction, volatility, and institutional stability through a compounding entropy framework.
## Cultural Entropy: A Forensic Audit of Civilizational Coherence (1950–2025)

This repository contains the core simulation code used in the working paper
**“Cultural Entropy: A Forensic Audit of Civilizational Coherence (1950–2025)”**
by Sal Attaguile.

The model treats culture as a dynamical system rather than a moral narrative.
It formalizes the interaction between:

- Substrate Stability S(t)
- Extraction Pressure X(t)
- Volatility F(t)
- Cultural Entropy E(t)
- Recognition Coherence R(t)

Entropy is modeled as a compounding process driven by extraction and substrate
instability, producing nonlinear acceleration after threshold decades.

This code reproduces the decade-scale trajectories presented in the paper
and is intended as a transparent, testable foundation for further analysis,
extension, and critique.
